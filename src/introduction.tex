Quantum dispersion in graphene, understood as the relationship between energy levels and their respective wave vectors, is essential for explaining the outstanding electronic and transport properties observed in this unique two-dimensional material.
Its hexagonal lattice structure generates massless Dirac fermions, which gives rise to particular quantum phenomena such as extremely high mobility, ballistic transport at micrometric scales, and intrinsic absence of a band gap\cite{Serna2019}.
Among these phenomena, it is especially interesting to study the role of SOIR, which can significantly modify electronic behavior and lead to novel interference and scattering effects related to electron spin.

The precise understanding of these interactions is critical not only from a theoretical perspective but also represents the fundamental basis for emerging technological applications in strategic areas such as spintronics and quantum computing\cite{WeizheMaterials2017, AvsarNatCommun2014, LiuNano2023}.
In this context, the Schr√∂dinger equation provides the fundamental framework for analyzing electronic transport, with its numerical solution being particularly suitable through robust methods such as the finite difference technique (FDM).
Consequently, the central objective of this work is to calculate in detail the energy dispersion relations for electrons in monolayer graphene under SOIR interaction using Gaussian wave packets, highlighting how these quantum effects can be exploited for the advanced engineering of nanotechnological devices specialized in spintronic and quantum information applications.


Finally, it is worth noting that one of the essential aspects addressed in this work lies in the precise analytical formulation of the current vector, whose analytical expression is given by equation\eqref{eq:componentes}.
This expression represents a fundamental pillar for understanding in detail the effects and underlying mechanisms in electronic transport phenomena in the presence of SOIR\@.
Therefore, the derivation and analysis of this equation constitutes a significant contribution to the field, especially in applications related to spintronic devices and emerging quantum technologies.


%\subsection{Weak Localization}\label{subsec:weak-localization}
%
%        Weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) are quantum phenomena arising from the interference of electron waves in disordered materials.
%         In graphene, these effects are heavily influenced by spin-orbit interactions (SOI), which describe the coupling between an electron's spin and its momentum.
%          Strong SOI can cause a transition from WL to WAL, modifying the phase coherence length (the distance over which electron waves maintain their phase relationship) and impacting electrical conductivity\cite{WeizheMaterials2017,AvsarNatCommun2014}.
%           This transition is crucial for understanding spin interactions within graphene and designing quantum devices.

\subsection{Klein Paradox}\label{subsec:kleinParadox}

Applying an electrostatic potential to graphene can create regions where electrons are classically forbidden due to energy constraints\cite{SoninPhysRevB2009}.
For instance, a negative gate voltage can shift the Fermi level into the valence band, establishing a potential barrier that electrons do not have sufficient energy to overcome, according to classical physics\cite{DellAnnaJPhysCondMatt2018}.
However, in graphene, electron transmission through such barriers can exhibit unusual behavior due to the Klein paradox.

The Klein paradox describes the phenomenon where electrons in graphene can tunnel through electrostatic potential barriers with a probability approaching unity, even at perpendicular incidence, seemingly defying the principles of classical mechanics\cite{TrauzettelNature2007}.
This counterintuitive transmission arises from the relativistic nature of electrons in graphene, where, within the barrier region, incident electrons can be converted into holes, allowing for unimpeded passage\cite{BernardiniJPhysAMathTheor2010}.
The Klein paradox is a direct consequence of graphene's unique linear dispersion relation and the associated massless Dirac fermion behavior.
While this perfect transmission through barriers might pose challenges for achieving electron confinement in some device designs, it also presents opportunities for developing novel tunneling-based electronic devices.
Beyond simply creating a forbidden region, the application of electrostatic potential can dramatically alter electron transmission through various other mechanisms, influencing the refractive index and leading to phenomena like electron lensing\cite{ParedesPhysRevB2021}.

\subsection{Rashba-Type Spin-Orbit Interaction}\label{subsec:rashba-type-spin-orbit-interaction}

SOIR is a relativistic effect that arises in systems lacking structural inversion symmetry\cite{AvishaiPhysRevB2021}.
SOIR is especially relevant due to its ability to significantly modify the electronic structure of graphene, inducing particular couplings between the spin and momentum of electrons.
This leads to emerging phenomena such as spin-dependent quantum interference and unconventional scattering effects.
The impact of SOIR not only provides new perspectives in fundamental physics but also opens promising possibilities for advanced applications in spintronic technologies and quantum information-based devices.

In graphene, SOIR can be induced by an external electric field applied perpendicular to the graphene plane or through proximity to a substrate\cite{ShcherbakovSciAdv2021}.
A key consequence of SOIR is the breaking of spin degeneracy, where the energy levels of electrons with opposite spins are no longer the same, even in the absence of an external magnetic field\cite{DelkhoshPhysE2015}.
Controlling spin degeneracy through electric fields via SOIR is particularly valuable for spintronic applications.
It enables electron spin manipulation without depending on magnetic fields, which typically require more power and are challenging to incorporate effectively into nanoscale systems.


Furthermore, SOIR modifies the effective mass of charge carriers in graphene\cite{WangPhysRevX2016}.
It can lead to the opening of an energy gap at the Dirac points, effectively giving the otherwise massless Dirac fermions a finite mass.
In systems with strong spin-orbit coupling, such as certain heavy-hole systems, specific types of SOIR (like $k^3$-Rashba spin-orbit coupling) can even result in anisotropic band structures and the emergence of additional spin-degeneracy points under light illumination.
While this specific example refers to heavy holes, the principle that SOIR can significantly alter the band structure and effective mass of carriers is relevant to graphene, particularly when considering proximity-induced effects from substrates with strong spin-orbit coupling\cite{GindikinPhysRevB2025}.
The modification of the effective mass by SOIR can profoundly impact graphene's transport properties, influencing carrier mobility and the density of states.
Notably, tuning the strength of SOIR in graphene can even induce a transition from the Klein tunneling regime (perfect transmission) to the anti-Klein tunneling regime (perfect reflection) when electrons encounter a potential barrier.
This ability to control the transmission probability through potential barriers using SOIR opens up exciting possibilities for creating novel electronic devices that leverage this fundamental quantum mechanical phenomenon\cite{YaoMater2024}.

In the next section, the physical-mathematical model adopted in this study will be described in detail.
Building on the conceptual foundation presented earlier regarding quantum dispersion and Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction, the system and corresponding equations that allow numerical simulation of the phenomena observed in our results will be defined.


%    \subsection{Quantum Dispersion and Anomalous Hall Effect}\label{subsec:quantum-dispersion-and-anomalous-hall-effect}
%
%    These interactions also impact quantum dispersion, the relationship between an electron's energy and momentum.
%    The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), where a transverse voltage arises without an external magnetic field, has been observed in edge-bonded monolayer graphene\cite{LiuNano2023}.
%     This demonstrates both ordinary and anomalous Hall effects, indicating long-range ferromagnetic order (spontaneous alignment of electron spins) and suggesting applications in carbon-based spintronics\cite{YaoMater2024}.
%      The theoretical prediction of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in graphene-based heterostructures further highlights the potential for hosting non-trivial topological phases.
%
%
%    Electrostatic potential and Rashba spin-orbit interaction dramatically alter electron transmission in graphene, even at perpendicular incidence, defying the Klein paradox.
%
%This results from the potential generating a classically forbidden region, SOIR breaking spin degeneracy and modifying the heavy hole's effective mass, spin-dependent scattering at interfaces, the emergence of quasi-bound states that enable resonant tunneling, and the heavy hole's effective mass playing a crucial role in tunneling dynamics.
%
%      These factors, particularly the deviation from the Dirac point dispersion relation, significantly modify transmission, requiring further computational and experimental investigation to fully elucidate this phenomenon and refine our understanding of graphene electron transport.
