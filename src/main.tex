% Abstract
    \begin{abstract}
        This paper presents a theoretical and computational study on the impact of Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOIR) on electron transmission through a potential barrier in monolayer graphene.
        The energy dispersion relations were numerically obtained via the finite differences method applied to the Schrödinger equation, using a model Hamiltonian incorporating graphene, SOIR, and a potential barrier.
        Our findings reveal that the presence of SOIR significantly modifies the electron transmission coefficients compared with pristine graphene conditions.
        While electron transmission in pristine graphene remains near unity with minor reductions due to quantum interference effects in a Gaussian wave packet, introducing SOIR leads to intricate transmission patterns dependent on the barrier parameters and wave packet characteristics.
        These effects arise from phenomena such as spin degeneracy lifting and spin-dependent scattering mechanisms.
        The results emphasize the critical role that SOIR plays in engineering sophisticated quantum devices, offering potential applications in spintronic technologies and quantum computing.

    \section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

    In this study, we investigated theoretically and computationally the influence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOIR) on electron transmission across a potential barrier in monolayer graphene.
    We demonstrated that introducing SOIR significantly modifies electron transmission coefficients, generating complex patterns that are absent in pristine graphene.

    An interesting contradiction emerged regarding electron transmission observed in pristine graphene compared to existing literature.
    While pristine graphene commonly exhibits near-perfect transmission due to suppressed electron backscattering, our results indicated small yet notable transmission reductions.
    These deviations were attributed to characteristics of the Gaussian wave packet used, specifically quantum interference phenomena, highlighting the sensitivity of electron transport properties to subtle variations in experimental and simulation conditions.

    Moreover, the inclusion of rashba SOIR introduced additional small but meaningful variations in transmission coefficients.
    This effect was closely linked to the interaction between electron pseudo-spin components, influenced distinctly by the direction and magnitude of the initial wave vector.
    Our observations underscore the delicate yet impactful role pseudo-spin dynamics play in modifying electron transport properties within graphene-based systems.

    Future studies could focus on systematically analyzing the relationship between phase time or tunneling times and these observed transmission variations induced by SOIR. Such exploration could offer deeper insights into the quantum mechanical principles governing transport phenomena in graphene and related materials.

    Ultimately, our findings highlight the potential of exploiting Rashba spin-orbit interaction to precisely control electron transmission through potential barriers, paving the way toward innovative electronic and spintronic devices, as well as advancing quantum computing technologies.
