Even the successful proposition presented by Wong and Mireles \cite{WongUNAM2005} according to what $\alpha = -\beta$, we considered not to follow their conclusions, as they are differences to be taken into account. Thus, we rather calculate the values of the coupling constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$, basing our approach on the equations proposed by themselves \cite{WongUNAM2005}, namely:

\begin{align}
    \alpha &= \frac{eE_b P^2}{3E_i\left( E_i + E_g \right)}\label{eq: alfa}\\
    \beta &= -\frac{eE_b P^2\left( 2E_i + E_g \right)}{3E_i\left( E_i + E_g \right)^2 k_c^2}\label{eq: beta}\\
    E_i &= \frac{2P^2 k_c^2}{3E_g} \label{eq: E_i}\\
    \frac{2P^2}{m_0 E_g} &= \frac{m_0}{m^*} - 1 \label{eq: P2}\\
    E_b &= \frac{V_b}{el} \label{eq: E_b}
\end{align}

\noindent where $e$ is the elementary charge, $P$ is the momentum matrix element, $E_g$ is the band gap, $k_c$ is a critical wave number that satisfies $k \ll k_c$, $m_0$ is the free-electron mass, $m^*$ is the effective mass used to parametrize the QB region, $V_b$ is the QB height, and $l$ is the barrier width. In our modeling, spin-charge carriers fD remain graphene electrons outside the QB; meanwhile the heavy-holes contribute inside the QB and then a Rashba functional form is used as an effective SOIR in that region.

Consistently with previous experimental data reported elsewhere \cite{HuntSci2013, FuhrerSci2013, PallaBullMaterSci2016}, we choose  $E_g = 0.03$ eV; $m^* = 0.47m_0$; and also the critical wave number $k_c = 0.2$ \AA$^{-1}$. If we substitute these numerical values, we can use~\eqref{eq: P2} to obtain $P^2=1.54\times10^{-32}$ kg$\cdot$eV; and, therefore, $E_i = 1.37\times10^{-32}$ eV\@. Finally, we define the width and height of the QB based on different physical models already presented in the literature. Using these numerical results, we can find $\alpha$ and $\beta$. For example, if $l=100$ \AA\, and $V_b = 0.5$ eV, then $\alpha = 0.25$ eV$\cdot$\AA\, and $\beta = -1.56$ eV$\cdot$\AA.

%alpha should be between 0.06 and 0.4 evA
